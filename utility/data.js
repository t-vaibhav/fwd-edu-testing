Her regular tests, doubt sessions and persistence made all subjects a cakewalk. Her notes are an incredibly useful asset, and they are useful even for college exams.

She taught us time management and organisational skills and her wonderful notes, individual attention and ample test series made us score really well in our examinations. I enrolled in Forward Education in 12th standard and the entire session was online due to the Covid-19 pandemic but her zest, dedication, devotion, efforts and interactive online sessions made the subjects very interesting and a cakewalk for all of us. Hats off to the teacher. Do enrol yourself at Forward Education for a wonderful experience.",
